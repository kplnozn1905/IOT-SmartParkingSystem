# **IOT-SmartParkingSystem**  
  

### *Simple jobs like car-acquired and parking with a world-class couple just got harder. It is expected to worsen in the coming years, leading to conflicts such as lack of parking and traffic problems. Along with the innovations of technology, IoT plays a critical role in our daily life. The IoT has made smart cities possible. Smart parking services also play an important role. Here is an idea thought about smart parking system using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. This system aims to replace the traditional parking system with high-tech, IoT-based smart parking using RFID. It is aimed to terminate the data reception by using bluetooth serial port communication between the hardware and the computer, to apply the problems of finding a place in the car parks and loading the balance.*  
  

## The project consists of 4 tasks and the tasks are listed below:  
  

* ðŸš§Speed control for barriers at entrances and exits*  
  

* ðŸ…¿Determining the number of parking spaces*  
  

- *ðŸ’³User balance check and upload*  
  

- *ðŸ”† Adjusting the brightness of vehicle lights*

## Conculsion and Recommendations  
In this study, it has been shown that existing parking problems can be solved with IoT systems. Problems such as lack of space in the car parks, lack of information about the place, irregular entrances and exits, and inability to close the car park (reservation system) have been taken into account. It has been shown that a reservation system can be created with the system of determining the number of parking spaces. It has been realized that location conditions can be viewed remotely with C# Form and that these systems can also be applied over the web and mobile. With the user balance control system, the remaining balance information and user names were learned and the balance was loaded.

It has been observed that many objects can be controlled remotely with barrier speed and vehicle headlight control systems. Connection is provided with 3 microcontrollers using the serial port. It has been seen that the number of these connections can be increased and more than one bluetooth can be connected to a computer.
